Omission/Deletion & Removing the specific words or phrases that are believed to leak the attribute.\\ \hline

Adding Ambiguity & Introducing language that makes the inference less certain. Involves introducing uncertainty to make the statement itself unclear, open to multiple interpretations, or to obscure the information.
\\
